## Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game (C Programming)

This is a console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) game written in C programming language.
It was created as one of my early practice projects during my 1st semester in the CSE program.
This game expands the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors by adding Lizard and Spock, making it more interesting and fun to code!

## Game Rules
The extended rules are:

Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock

The game compares the choices of the user and the computer and displays the result.

## Features
Written in C using basic conditionals and logic

Simple terminal-based interface
Random computer choice
Score tracking between user and computer
Clear display of each round’s outcome

## How to Run
Clone or download the repository.

Compile using any C compiler like Codeblocks or VsCode


## Concepts Used
if-else and switch-case statements

rand() function for randomness

Loops (while, for)

User input/output

Basic functions
